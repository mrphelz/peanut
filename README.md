PEANUT
======
the small php framework

About
-----
Peanut is "just another php framework" (tm), developed by Phelipe de Sterlich @ Moorea Software.
It's basically a way to learn php & git (& github), and a basic framework for site building, written mainly for internal usage.
Development is in progress, documentation is completely absent, but if someone is really interested in this (i hardly doubt), feel free to test & use & do whatever you want (included dropping me a line if help is needed).
