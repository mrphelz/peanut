PEANUT
======
the small php framework

About
-----
Peanut is "just another php framework" (tm), developed by Phelipe de Sterlich @ Moorea Software.

It's basically a way to learn php & git (& github), and a basic framework for site building, written mainly for internal usage.

Development is in progress, documentation is completely absent, but if someone is really interested in this (i hardly doubt), feel free to test & use & do whatever you want (included dropping me a line if help is needed). And, if someone is crazy enough to use (i even more hardly doubt) it but good enough to make real money from it (easier to found a lamborghini aventador in my garage than this really happening), well ... i wouldn't mind to have some too :-)
